# Sync Her Up
Our InnovateHer Hackathon project.

### Inspiration
According to the WHO, "Worldwide, only 2 out of 5 schools (39%) provide menstrual health education.", and menstruation itself is often a heavily stigmatized topic. This makes managing and learning more about it even more difficult. We wanted to change this by making menstrual cycle plans easier and more accessible to all by creating a friendly UI where users can gain insight on the types of food, exercise, and other information about their period with a few simple steps.

### What it does
Sync Her Up allows users to enter in their average cycle days as well as the days that their period has currently lasted to help generate what stage they are at in the cycle, food and exercise plans based on their situation, and more information about their period such as about their hormones.

### How we built it
We built this webapp through VSCode using HTML/CSS, Python, and implementing the Groq API to use for generating plans and information.

### Challenges we ran into
One of the initial challenges was establishing the foundation of the web application, as we were uncertain about how to begin structuring the project. Through persistent testing, iterative development, and guidance from tutorials and mentors, we successfully built the framework using HTML/CSS. Another major challenge involved integrating the Groq API into our web application. We encountered frequent errors during the setup process, which required debugging and troubleshooting to ensure proper functionality. These obstacles taught us valuable lessons about API integration and error handling.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the easy-to-use and friendly ui/ux that we created. Especially with such a stigmatized topic, our ui/ux, as well as fun graphics make it a lot easier to manage the intricacies of period cycles by making it more inviting and fun. In addition, our ui/ux is easy to pick up and use, making it accessible to all.

### What we learned
Through Sync Her Up, we were able to learn much more about creating webapps, such as building the framework for a website, implementing features such as calendars, and improving our HTML/CSS to make the webapp intuitive, streamlined, and visually appealing. We also gained more insight about creating a backend to process user input.

### What's next for Sync Her Up
Future development for Sync Her Up will focus on expanding functionality by implementing: 
- A login system for user authentication and session management, leveraging Auth0 for secure and scalable authentication.
- A database to store user data, including previous recommendations and favorite plans, enabling a more personalized experience.
- Advanced visualizations, such as an interactive circular menstrual cycle ring divided into phases. Users will be able to hover over and click on phases to access detailed information and insights.

By continuously enhancing its features, Sync Her Up aims to become a comprehensive and empowering tool for menstrual health management.
